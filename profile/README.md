## Ebenezer App 📖🙏🏽
Ebenezer is an app designed to help every Christian live a life closer to God. Just as Samuel remembered how God helped him and the Israelites and said: "Thus far the LORD has helped us." (1 Samuel 7:12b), this app aims to help everyone always remember how God has been guiding us daily.

This project is developed by me, [RaphaelGLv](https://github.com/RaphaelGLv), as the main developer, under the mentorship of [eliasjay](https://github.com/eliasjay), who shares his experience and guides me in applying best development practices throughout this project. It is my way of bringing an idea I believe to be God's will into reality while learning under J. Elias' guidance. Because of this, I would be honored to receive suggestions and issue reports to help improve the app and continue learning. Feel free to contribute!

God bless you, and enjoy! 🙌<br>
